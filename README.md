# TSF-GRIPNOV21-Task1
Hey everyone, this is the first task assigned to me as an Intern at The Sparks Foundation. In this project I have predicted the scores of a student using Supervised ML. I have used the linear Regression model for prediction and got the r_squared score of 0.89 which can be considered quite decent.
